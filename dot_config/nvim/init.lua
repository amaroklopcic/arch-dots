-- TODO:
-- 1. we need to come up with a dynamic way to set tab width depending on language in the buffer; if js/ts we need 2, anything else we need 4
-- 2. Harpoon for neovim looks cool, we should add this in later once we get more accustomed to neovim
-- 3. We should probably add tags/versions to our plugins so there's less chance a plugin can break our shii

require("vim-options")
